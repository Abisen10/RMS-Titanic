The most famous competition over the kaggle .
In this Repository my intention is to basically explain to every beginner but how to begin with Kaggle very first time. So this repository is for those who just begin. In this notebook i try to take down every single topic with a very naive approach so every beginner can grasp it very easily.



## Usage
Run this using [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Just type `jupyter notebook` in the main directory and the code will pop up in a browser window. 

## Goal for this Notebook:
Show a simple example of an analysis of the Titanic disaster in Python using a full complement of PyData utilities. This is aimed for those looking to get into the field or those who are already in the field and looking to see an example of an analysis done with Python.

## This Notebook will show basic examples of:

- Data Handling
- Importing Data with Pandas
- Cleaning Data
- Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

## Valuation of the Analysis
- K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
- Output the results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle
